I'm a CS student currently completing my Master majoring on Machine Learning & Big Data at the **University of Wollongong**, where I focus on building practical machine learning systems, intelligent automation, and data-driven applications.

Before moving to Australia, I completed my degree of **Electrical & Electronic Engineering** at **Imperial College London**. Across the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in:

- **Crypto & Risk analytics & AI agent** at _Binance_
- **AI engineering & large-scale RAG systems** at _JN Consulting Engineers_
- **Edge deep learning & audio ML** during my _ARM_ industry placement
- **AI agent prototyping & startup tooling** across several early-stage teams

These experiences shaped me into a builder who enjoys turning ambiguous workflows into reliable, data-driven systems.

## What I Work On

My current work centers on **practical, production-ready AI**, including:

- **AI Agents & LLM workflow automation**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and hybrid search systems
- **Risk analytics & data pipeline automation**
- **Real-time OCR + LLM systems for sensitive-information detection**
- **End-to-end engineering: data → models → APIs → deployment**

I enjoy bridging AI models with real operational workflows—designing tools that are fast, explainable, and genuinely useful to the people who rely on them.

## What I’m Building Toward

I aim to grow as an **AI Engineer / Data Engineer**, combining:

- strong **machine learning fundamentals**,
- practical **systems engineering**, and
- real-world **data intuition**.

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out—I’m always happy to connect.

My first hackathon, and the experience that pulled me into the world of AI agents.

I built a persona-driven agent system using Python, Streamlit, and the OpenAI API. Most of the time was spent figuring out how to structure prompts, handle tool-calling cleanly, and keep the system from wandering off-task.

The project was simple, but it opened my eyes to how flexible agent architectures can be — and how a small prototype can turn into something surprisingly functional with the right constraints.

VisionShield is a real-time OCR + LLM system designed to detect and redact sensitive on-screen content. 

I led a five-member team to build the entire pipeline: screen capture, PaddleOCR integration, retrieval-based classification, and LLM summarisation for generating explainable violation flags. Every part of the system had its own challenges — latency, text grouping, false positives, UI design.

This project is still ongoing and so far it already taught me a lot about turning academic ideas into something end-to-end and usable, and about coordinating a team around a technical problem that doesn’t have a single “correct” solution.

content = """
For my MEng research project at Imperial, I explored distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for portfolio management. 

I implemented metric-based ambiguity sets and the MAD framework using MATLAB (CVX) and Python, and compared performance using both historical and synthetic S&P 500 data.

It was my first time working with mathematical optimization in a research context, and it gave me a deeper understanding of risk, uncertainty modelling, and how theoretical ideas behave once you test them against real-world data.

Working in risk at Binance changed how I think about data.  
The pace is fast, the systems are complex, and the signals you see reflect real user behaviour happening in real time.

A lot of problems start out vague—I had to learn how to dig through noise, find patterns, and turn half-formed ideas into something concrete. Building automation and experimenting with AI agents showed me how even small tools can genuinely save time for the team.

It’s demanding work, but it pushed me to grow quickly and be comfortable dealing with uncertainty.

JN was the role that really made me understand what “applied AI” means.  
Working with a 16TB document repository forced me to think about retrieval, indexing, chunking, and how real systems behave under scale.

I built both a RAG search engine and a report-generation pipeline that engineers actually relied on day-to-day. Seeing people use what I built felt different from any school project—it made the work feel real.

This internship taught me that good engineering is about making someone’s job easier, not about building the fanciest model.

NUSEUM had the fast, scrappy feel of an early-stage startup.  
I worked on a function-calling AI agent to reduce hallucinations in product recommendations, which basically meant lots of testing, breaking things, and tuning prompts until the system behaved.

The part I enjoyed most was the freedom to try ideas quickly. It made me realise I enjoy early prototyping much more than I expected.

This was a very “hands-on everything” type of job.  
I maintained the company’s eCommerce website, cleaned up data, integrated supplier APIs, set up DNS and domains, and even helped with SEO and analytics.

It was the first time I saw how technology decisions directly affect a small business, and it taught me to think beyond the code itself.

content = """
At Arm, I built a real-time speaker recognition model and deployed it on Raspberry Pi devices with strict memory and latency limits.

Working under hardware constraints forced me to care about efficiency—model size, preprocessing, and performance mattered just as much as accuracy.  
Seeing the model finally run smoothly on a tiny device was incredibly rewarding and gave me a solid foundation for future ML engineering work.
